This is the rock, paper, scissors project from TOP, it's played only through the browser console using prompts.
This project solely prompts the user 5 times (5 Rounds of rock, paper, scissors), plays the user moves against the computer's random moves, tracks the score, and declares a winner.
As suggested by the project guidelines, there was very minimal error handling implementation, therefore the lack of user input was kept to a minimal standard intentionallY. This script simply does what it wasrequested by the project, nothing more, nothing less.
